## Introduction

RetinopatiaApp is a desktop educational application designed for training and
self-assessment of skills in recognizing diabetic retinopathy
from retinal fundus images.

The project combines interactive image annotation, user attention analysis,
and neural network–based evaluation to help users better understand
visual patterns associated with different stages of the disease.
