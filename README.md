## 🌟 Overview

RetinopatiaApp is an educational application powered by artificial intelligence, created to help medical students and ophthalmology specialists practice diabetic retinopathy staging using fundus images.

The project focuses on interactive learning with clear visual feedback, including model explainability to support better understanding of diagnostic features.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Training** - Practice staging diabetic retinopathy using medical images
- **AI-Based Classification** - Neural network predicts disease stage from fundus photos
- **Model Explainability (Grad-CAM)** - Highlights image regions that influenced the decision
- **User vs Model Comparison** - Helps identify mistakes and learn from feedback

### Learning Experience
- **Step-by-step workflow** - Mimics a real diagnostic process
- **Progress tracking** - Training history and statistics
- **Self-paced learning** - Useful for independent practice and reinforcement

### Educational Use
- **Safe training environment** - Educational purpose only
- **Scalable concept** - Can be extended with new datasets or additional conditions

## 🛠 Current Status

**Educational Prototype** - Core functionality implemented for demonstration and training purposes. The project can be expanded and improved.

## 📖 Documentation

Documentation and project details are provided in this repository (slides, report, and workflow description).
